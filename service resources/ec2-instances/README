Error: Missing resource instance key
│
│   on main.tf line 33, in resource "aws_volume_attachment" "ebs-volume-attachment":
│   33:   instance_id = "${aws_instance.terraform.id}"
│
│ Because aws_instance.terraform has "count" set, its attributes must be accessed on specific instances.    
│
│ For example, to correlate with indices of a referring resource, use:
│     aws_instance.terraform[count.index]
